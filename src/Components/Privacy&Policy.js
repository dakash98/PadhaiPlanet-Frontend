        PadhaiPlanet is an online platform created by students for students. The
        idea behind this initiative originated when the creators were pursuing
        their 10th examination. They found it challenging to familiarize
        themselves with the question papers for practice. Practicing old
        question papers is as crucial as studying the syllabus when aiming for a
        good rank or marks. Currently, PadhaiPlanet provides Maharashtra Board
        10th question papers, and there are further offerings that PadhaiPlanet
        plans to introduce in the near future.
